      <h1>ABOUT PROJECT</h1>
      <h2>June, 2023</h2>
      <p>Our Star Wars website project utilizes Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript to create an immersive experience for Star Wars enthusiasts. The site features an immersive horizontal scrollable navigation bar that responds dynamically to mouse input, creating an engaging user experience. </p>
      <p>When users click on the "See More" button, they are transported to the login page, their gateway to exclusive Star Wars content. The login page is meticulously designed using Flask's login system, incorporating modules like Flask-Login and WTForms. User passwords are securely encrypted using bcrypt, ensuring their confidentiality. </p>
      <p>To fortify our defenses against potential threats, we rely on the mighty SQLAlchemy database, where usernames and passwords are stored safely away from prying eyes. We've even implemented a sophisticated rate limiting mechanism that temporarily restricts access to the login page if users exceed the maximum threshold. </p>
        <p>Within the Star Wars-themed grid layout, users can delve into a treasure trove of captivating information. Navigating through the site is made easy with arrow buttons, seamlessly integrated using Jinja2 templates. Our code expertly extracts data from  API, unveiling hidden knowledge locked within JSON. These sacred texts reveal numerous dictionaries, each holding a piece of the Star Wars puzzle.</p>
      <p>With meticulous logic, we traverse these celestial archives, extracting vital information and presenting it in a format that would make even Master Yoda nod in approval.</p>
      <p>Our error handling capabilities ensure smooth operation, shielding against list out-of-bounds exceptions and other potential issues. Our project features sophisticated error handlers, providing Star Wars-themed HTML pages in the event of rare 404 errors. In the face of a formidable 429 error, our empathetic interface offers solace, guiding users through the necessary waiting time before resuming their intergalactic adventures.</p>
